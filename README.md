## Summary

---

I've loved the Star Wars Universe for as long as I could remember. That's what inspired me to create this site as my first API call application.

Galactic Oracle uses `Axios` to get data from the `Star Wars API`. The data returned is looped through a series of `promises` organized and sent back to `React` to be displayed on screen. In this project I used a `custom hook` with `useReducer` and used that with `useContext` to control the global flow of the application. The application is styled with `Bootstraps` and deployed to `Heroku`. This project has helped me become comfortable with React and deploying to Heroku.
