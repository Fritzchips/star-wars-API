## Summary

---

I've loved the Star Wars Universe for as long as I could remember. That's what inspired me to create this site as my first API call application.

There was a lot of problem solving involved with this application. Ranging from API calls, timed cache, and global code reusability. My knowledge of React and react hooks has strengthened with this experience.
